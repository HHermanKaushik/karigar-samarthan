# Karigar Samarthan (Flutter App)

A **voice‑first Android Flutter application** designed to help Indian artisans (karigars) easily create, manage, and market product listings with **minimal typing, reduced navigation complexity, and assistive AI guidance**.

This repository contains the **mobile layer** of the Karigar Samarthan system. The IVR Helpline, Volunteer-Entry fallback method, and any other supportive layers are organized within the "extra services" subdirectory.

 ├── components/        # Reusable UI components (ActionCard, VoiceButton, etc.)
 ├── pages/             # App screens (Home, Language Selection, Add Product Wizard)
 ├── theme.dart         # Centralized theme & colors
 ├── nav.dart           # App routing
 └── main.dart          # App entry point
```

## ▶️ Running the App (Local Setup)

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK installed
* Android Studio / Android SDK
* An Android emulator or physical device

### Steps

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter run
```

---

## 👥 Team Collaboration Workflow

We follow a **branch‑based workflow** to keep `main` stable.

### Branches

* `main` → stable, demo‑ready builds only
* `feature/<feature-name>` → new features
* `fix/<issue-name>` → bug fixes

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/voice-product-flow
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Expectations

Before pushing code:

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test   # when tests exist
```

No code should be merged to `main` if:

* `flutter analyze` shows errors
* The app does not launch

## 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

Please read carefully before contributing.

### 1. Do NOT commit generated files

These are already handled by `.gitignore`:

* `build/`
* `.dart_tool/`
* `android/.gradle/`
* `ios/Pods/`

---

### 2. Adding a New Page

1. Create the page in `lib/pages/`
2. Register route in `nav.dart`
3. Keep widgets **small and reusable**
4. Prefer stateless widgets unless state is required

---

### 3. Coding Conventions

* lowerCamelCase for variables & methods
* UpperCamelCase for classes
* One widget per file (where possible)
* Keep UI logic separate from navigation logic

---

### 4. Commit Message Format

Use clear, scoped commits:

```text
feat: add voice‑guided product wizard
fix: resolve navigation crash on home page
refactor: simplify ActionCard layout
```
